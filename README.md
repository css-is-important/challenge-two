# CSS is !important - Challenge Two: Coming Soon
CSS is !important - Challenge Two: Coming Soon

## Challenge notes
- The main sitemap is made from a single `ul`. Bonus points will be awarded if you don't use any classes here _at all_
## The Rules
There's really only one rule to this: *You may not edit the HTML*

You can add classes, but the structure of the HTML must not change.

Actually there is another rule... Everything you do must be done in CSS. No javascript should be used aside from what's there.
## Running the repo
- If you don't already have grunt.js on your computer, run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- Clone the repo to your computer
- Run `npm install`
- Run `grunt`
- The page will run at `localhost:9000`
## Taking part
- Create a `entries/your-name` branch from `master`
- Follow https://github.com/BennyHudson
- You will be added as a contributor to the `css-is-important` organisation
- Write your best CSS
- Push your branch
- Profit
## Things to note
- There may be some `id`s in the HTML. These are purely for javascript and should not be changed.
- Colours are predefined and are available inside `stylesheets/dev/colours.scss`
- Spacing values are not provided. You may choose a suitable value, as long as it is consistent across the page - don't worry about pixel-perfection.
- Treat this as a real, content-driven website - don't make things too specific!
## Helpers
- Font Awesome Pro is included in this project
- There are some predefined mixins that may come in handy. These can be found in `stylesheets/dev/mixins.scss`
- The default browser styles have been disabled with `stylesheets/dev/reset.scss`
- _Very_ basic styles have been added to `stylesheets/dev/global.scss` to get you started
- A basic build of Modernizr has been added for cross browser testing. If you need more, create your own at https://modernizr.com/
## Browsers, Devices & Extras
- Your code should work consistently across all modern browsers
- You should give consideration to responsive design. Desktop first media queries are included inside `stylesheets/dev/media.scss`
- Mobile screenshots are not provided. Just do what feels right
